My preparation lasted around 4 to 6 weeks, depending on daily availability. These were the most helpful resources:

✔ Kubernetes Documentation (Primary Reference)
The official docs are the closest thing you have to the exam environment.
• https://kubernetes.io/docs/

✔ KodeKloud CKA Course
An excellent hands-on course with labs that simulate the real exam experience.
• https://www.kodekloud.com/courses/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/

✔ Killer Shell (Official Practice Exam)
The practice tests are harder than the real exam — which is exactly why they prepare you so well.

✔ CNCF Exam Handbook
Understanding the rules and exam structure is essential.
